Relevant Information:

   This dataset is based on "Bank Marketing" UCI dataset (please check the description at: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing).
   The data is enriched by the addition of five new social and economic features/attributes (national wide indicators from a ~10M population country), published by the Banco de Portugal and publicly available at: https://www.bportugal.pt/estatisticasweb.
   This dataset is almost identical to the one used in [Moro et al., 2014] (it does not include all attributes due to privacy concerns). 
   Using the rminer package and R tool (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rminer/), we found that the addition of the five new social and economic attributes (made available here) lead to substantial improvement in the prediction of a success, even when the duration of the call is not included. Note: the file can be read in R using: d=read.table("bank-additional-full.csv",header=TRUE,sep=";")
